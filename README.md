This website set out to display a visually pleasing index/home page that the user can clearly see the two options offered to them.
These two options are learning how to play either chords or tabs on a guitar.

In each of these two pages there is a sample warm-up video displayed at the top of the page that the user may find helpful to find their footing or warm up to practicing their song choice.

Under this, there is a list view of 7 sample songs they can learn based on their choice.

In the index/home page there is also an option at the top to submit a song request that they wish to learn from the website. This link takes them to a submittion form that they can fill out and input their option of song with the chord or tab version that they wish to have uploaded.

The logo in the header of the submission form also contains an anchor to the home page in the event that they wish for a quick and easy return to the main page.
